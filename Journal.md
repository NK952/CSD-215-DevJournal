## Intro to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of computing power and other IT resources through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing, meaning you only pay for what you use.

Unlike cloud computing, traditional computing has a long procurement cycle, requires space, staff, physical security and capital expenses. 

Cloud computing models allow for more flexible software solutions. You can terminate unneeded resources on-demand and pay only for what you use. You can also scale resources up or down fairly easily.

### Cloud Service Models
There are 3 main CSMs. IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

**1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** The services in this category usually provide you with access to features such as networking, computers, and data storage space. This has the highest level of flexibility and control over the IT resources you paid for.

**2. PaaS (Platform as a Service):** There is less freedom over the hardware and OS, which gives you time to focus on deployment and management of applications.

**3. SaaS (Software as a Service):** With this, the service provider gives you the complete product, which means there is no need to think about how the infrastructure is managed, only the software given to you.
